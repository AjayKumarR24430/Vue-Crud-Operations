# MEVN Stack CRUD APPLICATION

### Client details built using a MEVN stack (Vue.js + Node.js + Express + MongoDB) with a CRUD Application. 

The back-end server uses Node.js + Express for REST APIs, front-end side is a Vue client with Vue Router and axios.


### Node JS Express:

#### Does two types of interactions:
* ODM (Object Document Mapping) that interacts with the Mongo Database.
* Restful API that interacts with the Vue JS application.

### Vue JS:

* Has router which does the routing in single-page application
* Individual components that interacts with the backend using protocols like http.

– Node.js Express exports REST APIs & interacts with MongoDB Database using Mongoose ODM.
– Vue Client sends HTTP Requests and retrieves HTTP Responses using axios, consume data on the components. Vue Router is used for navigating to pages.
